		<p>
			Thank you for caring enough to investigate my disappearance. It really means a lot; I hope you finding this doesn’t mean I’m dead. But operating under that assumption,
			I have left a cryptex hidden in my house with all of my evidence to out the rook organization. I am assuming you have read my journal and understand why that is important. If you haven’t found it yet, a good place to start is either the wooden puzzle piece or my birding field guide. In the cryptex is a flash drive. Please deliver it to the San Francisco police department; If you talk to the organized crime unit, they should recognize my name.
			In case the cryptex is found by rook, I have split the combination across several of these encrypted web pages hinted at in puzzles that I think you will be able to solve, and I hope that they will not.

			This esteemed campus, with its rich academic heritage and intellectual vibrancy, holds valuable insights into the operations of the elusive rook organization. While Stanford University stands as a beacon of knowledge, it is also important to exercise caution, as rook's reach knows no bounds. 
			Remain vigilant as you navigate the corridors of this prestigious institution, as hidden within its walls may lie the key to unraveling the mysteries surrounding rook.
