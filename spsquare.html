		<p>
			Thank you for caring enough to investigate my disappearance. It really means a lot; I hope you finding this doesn’t mean I’m dead. But operating under that assumption,
			I have left a cryptex hidden in my house with all of my evidence to out the rook organization. I am assuming you have read my journal and understand why that is important. If you haven’t found it yet, a good place to start is either the wooden puzzle piece or my birding field guide. In the cryptex is a flash drive. Please deliver it to the San Francisco police department; If you talk to the organized crime unit, they should recognize my name.
			In case the cryptex is found by rook, I have split the combination across several of these encrypted web pages hinted at in puzzles that I think you will be able to solve, and I hope that they will not.

			During my relentless pursuit, I unraveled a crucial lead that led me to San Pedro Square. This bustling market and a hub of activity is the perfect place to covertly hide another clue to help you along your journey.
			The treacherous nature of the rook organization demands utmost care, keep a weary eye out and good luck in your continued efforts.
